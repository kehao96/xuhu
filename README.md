Title of project: Online electricity bills system with a seasonal electricity consumption prediction module using well trained neural network model.

Introduction/Motivation: Today there are many different forms of power plants supplying cities with electricity. There is an overcapacity of power plants. Over-generation can lead to many problems, such as waste of resources, environmental pollution, etc. So, can machine learning ideas be used to predict next year's electricity within a region? If the electricity consumption can be predicted in advance and with acceptable accuracy, power plants can plan their generation and dispatch schedules in advance. While ensuring that the region is supplied with electricity, it can also save resources and avoid overuse of high-powered generators.
Since the type and number of electrical appliances used in each household tends to be stable, it should be feasible to predict seasonal regional electricity consumption using the existing predictive neural network model. There are many predictive models already available. In this project, we will focus on neural network prediction model. The data used is the estimated electricity consumption obtained from the survey statistics. And we will also develop a web application, which is an online electricity bills system, for users to pay electricity bill. Our data will be collected from the system and preprocess it before handing to prediction model. Besides, the web application (the system) will be able to support other functionalities for users, like doing summaries on the electricity usage, etc.
